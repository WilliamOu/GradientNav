# GradientNav
GradientNav is an open-source project initially developed for the Bionic Vision Lab at the University of California, Santa Barbara, designed to facilitate research on sensory/gradient-based navigation.

The most up-to-date build of the study may be found under 'Build & Patch History/', which contains the setup for conducting the original study (refer to "Original Gamemodes & Objectives" for details). Download of the entire repository for the source code is only necessary for those interested in modifying or expanding the study (see "Source Code & Unity Asset Store Policy" for instructions on how to rebuild the project).

# Original Gamemodes & Objectives
The participant is tasked with a sensory substitution/augmentation task. Only able to see a single, gradient color, which changes depending on position, their goal is to find the brightest point in a map using only luminance cues. In other words, we wish to find how well a participant can navigate to the brightest point of a map given only a single degree of freedom for stimuli.

Trials can be generated randomly, via a seed, or using a preset CSV specifying a list of trials.
