# GradientNav
NOTICE: This project only recently began development. Many features are incomplete.

GradientNav is an open-source project initially developed for the Bionic Vision Lab at the University of California, Santa Barbara, designed to facilitate research on sensory/gradient-based navigation.

The most up-to-date build of the study may be found under 'Build & Patch History/', which contains the setup for conducting the original study (refer to "Original Gamemodes & Objectives" for details). Download of the entire repository for the source code is only necessary for those interested in modifying or expanding the study (see "Source Code & Unity Asset Store Policy" for instructions on how to rebuild the project).
